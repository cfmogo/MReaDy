MReaDy_OH_1.9
Obtained from MReaDy_HO2_0.9



MReaDy_HO2_0.9
-Corrections on the limits and flags of numbHO2 and maxflagst in verlet_alg.f90	 
MReaDy_HO2_0.8.7
-Correction on the agrupa file!
indices i,k related to atoms and must relate to lines in group matrix
Results are the same with version MReaDY_HO2_0.7

MReaDy_HO2_0.8.6
removed time = -1 and is now in variables.f90 

MReaDy_HO2_0.7.0.5 (correction based on running version)
- Correction made on the printing of geo*.xyz by printing total_real_time


MReaDy_HO2_0.8.5
removed "use (module)" from some files 

MReaDy_HO2_0.8

integration of kdtree in agrupa file
correction from natoms_react to npart

MReaDy_HO2_0.7

-Corrections on the generation files
-Inclusion of inner switches for transitions between diatomics and long-range


- input_file is not used anymore. 
The program as now to be to always compiled. 
It avoids allocated variables. 
Gains of execution time in the order of  10%

- Optimization of the cycles

- openMP was used in the main routines

- kdtree is used locating neighbours both for the nanotube and reacting particles
